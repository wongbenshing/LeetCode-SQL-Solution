# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
  Score,
  (SELECT count(*) FROM (SELECT distinct Score s FROM Scores) tmp WHERE s >= Score) AS Rank
FROM Scores
ORDER BY Score desc

# Use [DISTINCT] to Rank the different score values
# More faster: MySQL could make tmp a temporary table and uses it for every outer Score.
